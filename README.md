# FrontEnd
  This project was made as a school project by Lambda School students. 
  
  It is a basic ticket tracking system for any students who are in need of help with a particular blocker in their code. Users can be students, staff, or both. Under the 'ask for help' page student accounts have the ability to post new tickets. From the dashboard staff accounts have the ability to 'claim' unclaimed tickets. From the 'mytickets' page staff has the ability to 'unclaim' or 'complete' tickets. In both locations staff accounts have the ability to permanently delete tickets. Accounts can be created and accessed.
